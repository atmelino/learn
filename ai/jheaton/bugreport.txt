class_08_4_bayesian_hyperparameter_opt: optimizer bounds can lead to infinite loop

The bounds for neuronShrink are set to 
code "neuronShrink": (0.01, 1),

If neuronShrink is 1, the model generator basically tries to generate a model with infinite layers.
But even with values close to 1, I have experienced crashes.

For example, the 
model = generate_model(dropout=0.2, neuronPct=0.9, neuronShrink=0.985)
get error
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

An upper bound of 0.9 leads to a different problem:
When I set the variable
pbounds = {
    "dropout": (0.0, 0.499),
    "learning_rate": (0.0, 0.1),
    "neuronPct": (0.01, 1),
    "neuronShrink": (0.01, 0.9),
}

and run
